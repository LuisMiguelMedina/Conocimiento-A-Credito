# a) Selection of Usability NFRs

##It is selected according to the priority usability NFRs for the system based on objective and well-defined aspects.
To identify the objective and well-defined aspects that will guide the selection of the Non-Functional Usability Requirements (NFR), the user profile approach was followed. 
We clearly defined who the end users of the system will be and what their characteristics and needs are. This will help the team to better understand the usability priorities from the user's perspective.

Now, according to our end users who are young people who want to receive financial education between 18-24 and who study at FMAT, the priority usability RNFs were selected:
