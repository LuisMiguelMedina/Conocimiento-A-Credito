# 2 Overall Description 

## 2.1 Product functions 

The Knowledge on Credit will present information to the user in the form of quick interactive lectures and provide feedback on the answers the user enters. It will also allow the user to take notes on the lectures and share them with a community.  


## 2.2 User characteristics 

The user is our focal Persona: Ernesto Bocadillo. The main need of the user is the quality of the learning experience and information presented. He wants to learn on a mobile application with different types of tests and take text and diagram notes, he also wants to share his notes with a community, all that within a 20m time frame.

## 3.3 Non-functional Requirements
### Introduction

**Contents of the section**: This section describes the non-functional requirements that apply to the project. The non-functional requirements focus on the usability requirements.

**Document organization**: The document is divided into 3 sections: the first one indicates the non-functional requirements at the system level, while the other 2 apply to the two groups of functional requirements theyâ€™re applied to. Each section is divided into the specific functional requirements the non-functional requirements are attached: The funcional requirement appears as the title of the sub-section, while the non-functional requirement appear as bullet points. The Usability requirements are grouped by the usability factor they belong to. 

### 3.3.1 System Requirements
