# About the proyect

Our proyect it's all about a common issue we've noticed among young people - managing credit cards can be tricky. Many ends up in debt or even on delinquency lists. We're tackling this by developing a documentation specifically for FMAT students, designed to make learning about credit management both effective and interesting.

## Problem Statement

We found out that a lot of young folks struggle with credit cards because there aren't good learning tools out there for them. Most options are either too dull, too generic, or just hard to stick with. Plus, reliable info is hard to come by.

## Survey Insights

We wanted to really get what FMAT students need from such problems, so we sent out a survey asking about how they like to learn, how much time they have, and what kind of info they look for. The survey told us a lot. Most students have about 20 minutes a day for extra learning, prefer visuals, and feel lost with financial info.

## Personas

From this, we created three main user types - Ernesto, who loves depth and quality, Ángel, who’s all about visual learning, and Enzo, who learns best by doing. Understanding these personas helps us tailor our solution to be just right for everyone.

## Requirements:

With these insights, we outlined what our solution needs to do and be. Functionally, it must deliver info simply, fit learning into 20-minute chunks, and include both note-taking and practical exercises. It should also look clear and be easy to navigate, with intuitive graphics, legible fonts, and audio that's easy to follow. Basically, we want it to be super user-friendly and fun to use.

## Conclusion First Delivery:

So that's where we're at. We're creating a solution that cuts through the confusion of credit management and makes learning about it easy and engaging for FMAT students. Our team is looking forward to making this project a great success and making a real difference in how we manage our finances for young people.
