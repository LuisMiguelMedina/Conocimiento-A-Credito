# Instructions

1. Each team will include a repo folder named "Reflections". Inside this folder each member MUST include an individual folder using member's name, Example: "Edgar Cambranes".

2. Reflections must be published according the suggested title. All reflections must use PDF or MD file format. Any other format will be discarded. 

3. When using  definition, concepts, techniques, methods, o any other related concept, it MUST to include the reference (ACM/IEEE format).

4. Each reflexión should <mark>highlight</mark> the core of the reflection.

5. For this block, each member should select up to 4 (out of 6) reflection options.

6. If there is evidence an external tool was used to produce the content of the entry (reflection), the whole mark of reflection will be discarded.

NOTE: It is expected reflections to be published as soon is produced, therefore is it expected to reflections will be published along the block's period until the deadline.

As reference of the meaning a good reflection is you can review the following document:

| Section          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| ProcessingHCI | A challenge when dev teams work with quality attributes that require a large effort to verify and assess usually are left out or misunderstood of the process development. The mainstream of agile methods sometimes increase the hurdles rather to improve the process because teams miscalculate efforts. It is recognised an UX Lean as a technique to match the agile process. Based on the experience of your team: <br> - Key points of the Lean UX technique <br> - Considering the key points of the Lean UX Technique and based on the experience of your team's project, reflect on the process' team, could be considered lean? <br> - How much effort in terms of roles, activities, task would require your team's process to be considered lean? Is it worth in terms of benefits or cost? <br><br> Note: Use the following link as an initial resource. [A Simple Introduction to Lean UX](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/a-simple-introduction-to-lean-ux) |
| UsabilityvsUX | HCI has evolved and is widely used in recent years for product developments. There are diversifications of methods and techniques resulting in forming specific roles and approaches. For example, the role of UX is widely recognized, and it is part of many development teams and processes. However, it is important to have a clear distinction of the aim, task, methods, or techniques used specifically. Considering the differences explain the following points: <br> - How HCI, Usability, and UX are related. <br> - Describe ONE specific difference between Usability and UX. Provide an example based on your team's project. <br> - Based on the above explanations, provide a basic example of an "UX feature" which your team's project could be included (currently not included as part of your project). Be as specific as possible to map (or provide context) on the UX attribute and how it could be “observed” in your project. |
| ElicitationMethods | Elicitation methods are essential techniques/tools for User Research. Based on your team project provide a contrast of an elicitation technique used by the team based on an artifact on the project's repo. The goal of this reflection is to provide clear information regarding how close (or far) the team followed. Provide a constructive criticism of how the technique and resulting artifact could be improved. Provide following points: <br> - Considerations of the original technique. <br> - How your team did implement the technique? <br> - Outcome of the technique (based on artifacts). What could be improved? <br> - Reflect on how you could improve the technique/method/artifacts/items to collect data and analyze information, estimation time to process whole information, mistakes detected during the execution, etc. |
| Personas | Personas has become a relevant method to design products. Regular methods and techniques for designing products are based on functional features and demographic data of users. However, Personas is focused on providing a deeper understanding of the user based on users’ needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. Consider your team's project and based on the Personas Toolkit and Lene Nielsen template (both provided in the resources section) choose one category (needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals) and explain the following: <br> - What are specific items of the toolkit selected for collecting? Why are they relevant for your project/product? <br> - What was the method to collect the items? What's the method to analyze and synthesize the data for a specific item? <br> - Explain a specific example of the use of how it will be the influence or the impact Personas on the product. <br><br> Chapter from iXDF: [The Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/personas) |
| AITools | AI tools are in fashion. Developers are exploring the potential of tools such as chat GPT to generate automatically apps. There are many examples of code produced by AI tools. Research and select one tool, explore and try some examples to produce UI that includes specific features related to usability attributes. Based on your research and experience explain the real potential of the AI tools and the constraints. Provide some arguments related to the following points: <br> - What's the quality of the UI you could produce? <br> - How was your experience producing UI with an AI tool? Is it easy to use the AI tool? <br> - Considering the final result of the UI, to what extent does it include the usability attribute? <br> - Will the UX role change significantly with the development of AI tools? How? <br><br> Video link: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/uwSY9XqQGXw)
