# About the proyect

Our proyect it's all about a common issue we've noticed among young people - managing credit cards can be tricky. Many ends up in debt or even on delinquency lists. We're tackling this by developing a documentation specifically for FMAT students, designed to make learning about credit management both effective and interesting.

## Problem Statement

We found out that a lot of young folks struggle with credit cards because there aren't good learning tools out there for them. Most options are either too dull, too generic, or just hard to stick with. Plus, reliable info is hard to come by.
