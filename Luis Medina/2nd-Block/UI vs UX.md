# UI vs UX

### Differences Between UI and UX Design

| **Aspect**   | **User Interface (UI)** | **User Experience (UX)** |
|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Definition**  | Focuses on the visual and interactive elements of a product, like buttons, icons, colors, and layout [1][2].                                                               | Encompasses the overall experience a user has with a product, particularly in terms of how easy or enjoyable it is to use [2][3].                                                                  |
| **Purpose**   | Aims to create an aesthetically pleasing interface that engages users [1][2].                                                                | Seeks to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, enhancing user satisfaction [3][4].                                                                                                        |
| **Approach**  | Detailed attention to design elements that users will interact with directly [1][2].                                                             | Broader focus on user behavior and interaction with the entire product [2][3].                                                              |
| **Outcome**   | Can be aesthetically pleasing but might not necessarily be user-friendly if not designed with UX in mind [1][2].                                                                 | Prioritizes functionality and ease of use, which may or may not coincide with a visually appealing interface [3][4].                                                            |

### Examples from Team Project

1. **UI Example:**
   - **Element:** Dynamic Interfaces Inspired by Games
   - **Description:** <mark>In our project, we designed the quiz interface with vibrant colors and interactive elements</mark> similar to those in Duolingo. Each question type, like 'Match the Answers', uses distinct colors to indicate relationships between answers, making visual appeal and interaction clarity.</mark>
   - **Impact:** This approach makes the interface engaging, but without user input on the design, <mark>there could be mismatches in user expectations and actual functionality</mark>. (we found out later)

2. **UX Example:**
   - **Element:** User Feedback and Interaction Design
   - **Description:** <mark>During the usability testing phase, we gathered user feedback on the placement and color of UI elements</mark>. For instance, we used colors to indicate actions (red for negative actions), aiming to make interactions intuitive.
   - **Impact:** <mark>This feedback was crucial for adjusting the user interface to better suit user needs.</mark> (There's no better feedback than from the client itself.)
