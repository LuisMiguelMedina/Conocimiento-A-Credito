# UI design patterns

### Application of the UI Pattern: Guided Tour
In our educational app prototype, I was thinking about implementing the **"Guided Tour"** UI design pattern. It would be crucial for introducing users to the app's interface and functionalities in an intuitive and engaging manner.

<mark>The "Guided Tour" consists of a series of introductory overlays or pop-ups that activate during a user's first visit</mark>. These guides systematically walk the user through essential features of the app, such as the dashboard, lesson modules, and additional tools. <mark>Each step is designed to highlight a specific functionality with clear explanations, visual cues, and interactive elements that engage users and encourage exploration</mark> [1].

This implementation aims to achieve several usability objectives:
- **Reducing Initial Learning Curve:** By providing a guided walkthrough, <mark>the tour helps new users grasp the core functionalities without feeling overwhelmed, thus smoothing the initial interaction with the app</mark> [2].
- **Enhancing User Confidence and Independence:** <mark>Familiarizing users with the interface from the outset increases their confidence</mark> and enables more effective independent use of the app [2].
- **Improving User Retention:** An intuitive and supportive onboarding process <mark>can significantly increase the likelihood that users will continue using the app</mark>, as they understand how to navigate the platform and perceive its value from the beginning [3].

The integration of the "Guided Tour"  serves as a foundational element in making the platform accessible and appealing to new users. <mark>The best example is the "Ernesto Bocadillo" persona, who have limited time and would like fast things and clear information to have in hand</mark>, this implementations could exemplifie how user-centered design can be effectively used to enhance user satisfaction, ensuring that users feel welcomed and are empowered to fully utilize the app's features from their very first interaction. (we only need to see if this theory would apply well in our proyect)
