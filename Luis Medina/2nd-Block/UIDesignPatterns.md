UI Design Patterns represent "reusable/recurring components which designers use to solve common problems in user interface design". As proved solutions for regular interactions/UI designs, the patterns are often on UI Toolkits or UI Guidelines. During the process of selecting a toolkit/guidelines it is important to verify if basic UI patterns are present. 

Select a task (team project) of your UI/prototype designed so far. Define a relevant UI pattern and determine if it was applied or it should be. Either case, describe a specific implementation of the UI pattern and the relevance of it based on project's usability goals.
