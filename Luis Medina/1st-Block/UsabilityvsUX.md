## HCI, Usability, and UX

### **HCI** in our initiative <mark>is centered on the interaction between users and our platform</mark>[1]. We aim to design an interface that is intuitive, reducing technological barriers and facilitating equal educational access, reflecting a broad approach to understanding user interactions with technology [1].

### **Usability** is of paramount importance, especially considering that our target audience may lack experience with digital educational platforms. <mark>We prioritize making our platform navigable and straightforward, streamlining the process for course enrollment, accessing materials, and applying for financial aid</mark>. This focus ensures that users can achieve their objectives with minimal difficulty [2].

### A key distinction lies between **usability's** emphasis on the platform's ease of use and efficiency, and <mark>**UX's** broader consideration of the emotional and psychological impact on the user</mark>[4]. In our project, a feature aimed at usability is the streamlined process for scholarship and financial aid applications, which is designed for simplicity and speed. Despite its efficiency, feedback revealed that users felt overwhelmed by the choices, highlighting that effective functionality does not always equate to a positive overall experience [4].

### <mark> A key distinction lies between usability's emphasis on the platform's ease of use and efficiency, and UX's broader consideration of the emotional and psychological impact on the user</mark>. Example: In our project, a feature aimed at usability is the streamlined process for scholarship and financial aid applications, which is designed for simplicity and speed. Despite its efficiency, feedback revealed that users felt overwhelmed by the myriad of choices, highlighting that effective functionality does not always equate to a positive overall experience [3].

### <mark>A practical UX feature that could significantly enhance our project is a progress tracking system</mark>. This system would allow users to set educational goals and track their progress through various courses and activities. It would include visual progress bars, achievement badges, and personalized feedback based on the user's performance and engagement levels. <mark>This feature aims to motivate users by giving them a clear view of their achievements and what they need to work on, enhancing their learning experience [3].</mark>

### - Increased User Engagement
### Users might spend more time on the platform, engage more deeply with the content, and complete more courses [3].
### - Positive Feedback
### User feedback could indicate that the progress tracking system helps them feel more motivated and clear about their learning objectives [3].
### - Improved Learning Outcomes
### Over time, the system could lead to better learning outcomes, as users are more focused and can easily recognize areas needing improvement [3].
