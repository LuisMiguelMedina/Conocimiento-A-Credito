## Elicitation Methods Reflex

### Our team implemented user surveys with the goal of better understanding. This method was selected for its effectiveness in quickly reaching a wide audience and its ability to provide both qualitative and quantitative data. <mark>However, the effectiveness of surveys largely depends on their design [1]</mark>. By implementing user surveys in our project, we sought to deeply understand the expectations and requirements of our end-users. This method stood out for its efficiency in quickly reaching a wide audience and for its ability to offer both qualitative and quantitative data. <mark>Through this process, we faced the reality that the true challenge lies not only in formulating the right questions but also in how we manage and protect the collected information [1].</mark>

### <mark>The experience taught us that a well-thought-out survey design is just the tip of the iceberg</mark>. As we analyzed the responses, the diversity and depth of these made us appreciate more the importance of robust analytical methods and a survey design that facilitates both qualitative and quantitative analysis [3]. But <mark>beyond the survey structure and analysis techniques, we realized the urgent need to integrate security policies</mark> and privacy practices from the start [2].

### In designing the sampling strategy, we strove to reflect the diversity of our user base, but <mark>we also learned that segmentation must go hand in hand with protecting the privacy of participants</mark>. Maintaining anonymity and avoiding the misuse of personal data became a need in our research [2].
